# designscience-mpemulation
This is a repository contianing the code for mass property emulation, as discussed in Design Science.

The code is uploaded directly from development, and so has comments to myself, depracted code etc. in. It is also not a good example of Python code, nor should it be considered as such. It should, however, provide an understanding as to how the code worked that allowed for the directed optimisation of mass properties in 3D printed prototypes.

Please feel free to contact me or raisue an issue if you have any concerns, or would like the example .dat files.
